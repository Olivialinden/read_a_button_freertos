# README
This project is an embedded system designed to control a LED through a button using FreeRTOS on Stm32 microcontroller board.
There are 2 tasks, StartDefaultTask and StartTask02.StartDefaultTask is default task.StartTask02 is to detect whether the button has been pressed,
once the button is pressed, the LED will blink 3 times.

# Hardware Requirements
The following components are required to build the project:

STM32F446 Nucleao-64 board

# Software Requirements
STM32CubeIDE 1.11.2

# Installation
